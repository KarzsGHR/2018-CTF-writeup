# grep 1

## Q

Can you find the flag in file? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_3_8d9cff3d178c231ab735dfef3267a1c2 on the shell server.


## S

grep -e 'CTF.*' file

## A

picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_cdf2e7c2}
